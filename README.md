# Snowflake-To-E621
Why did I make this...

## How to use:
1. Download python https://www.python.org/
2. Create an e621 account (my biggest regret) https://e621.net
3. Edit the file and enter your username and api key e.g.
```py
### Get an API key from https://e621.net/users/home
username = "notafurry123"
api_key = "ABCDEF1234567890"
###
```
4. Run the program `python e621.py <SNOWFLAKE> <AMOUNT/LIMIT>` (the "snowflake" can be anything e.g. for discord id the first few results will be more unique)
5. Profit??
